I'm a Chinese student and I'm major in EE. I'm interested in the course,but i'm don't have enough time to finish it on time,because the subject--Digital Signal Processing and Principle of Communication is very difficult ,so i have to spend a lot of in them.  In addition, the gradescope is open to public in August.
